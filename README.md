# IdentityApp

This project was developed using ASP.NET Core Identity and Entity Framework Core, implementing authentication and authorization functionalities. A Code First approach was used with a SQLite database. Users can register, log in, and reset their passwords via email. Email confirmation is required after registration, and password reset operations are also handled through email. As part of the security measures, users are temporarily locked out after a certain number of failed login attempts, and accounts without email confirmation are restricted from logging in. Session management is handled via browser cookies, allowing users to stay logged in for a defined period. An admin panel is provided where administrators can manage user roles and update user information.
